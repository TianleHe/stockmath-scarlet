Data from the NASDAQ was collected on Wednesday July 8th

    Historical quotes are provided for most shares for all
trading days for a duration of up 10 years, although data
for some newer companies have less data, and others have
been limited to 5 years of data (due to what would most
politely be considered a programming bug on the NASDAQ
website or from whomever provides them their data. Which
if I remember correctly is You
will notice that despite being the NASDAQ 100, there are
more than 100 different CSV files in this folder, and 98
companies.

    The NASDAQ tool can be found at the following address.
Replace the XXXXX with the ticker you wish to search.

    Some companies have more than one type of shares. For
example, Alphabet Inc. has GOOG and GOOGL as two examples.
Historical prices for ORLY and VRSK are unavailable at the
time of data acquisition, so they have been left out.

    The data is formatted by default as six columns titled
Date, Close/Last, Volume, Open, High, Low. Where Date is in
MM/DD/YYYY starting with the most recent date in the first
row, Volume is int, and all others are two decimal double.
